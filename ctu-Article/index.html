                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Cebu Technological University (CTU) Danao was established in June 1949, following a resolution by the Danao Municipal Council, initially named "Danao Provincial High School." On June 22, 1957, it was transformed into a national vocational secondary school under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1907. In 1958, it was renamed Danao National Vocational School and placed under the supervision of the Cebu School of Arts and Trades in Cebu City.</p>
                <p>In 1963, the school secured an eight-hectare site in Barangay Sabang, and by 1964, it had two buildings with shop machines donated by the Colombo Aid from New Zealand. In July 1965, the school moved to its current location in Sabang, Danao City.</p>
                <p>Ten years later, it became Danao Vocational School and began offering a two-year trade technical program. In 1983, it became part of the Cebu State College of Science and Technology (CSCST) under Batas Pambansa 412. The following year, it became an independent chartered college called CSCST-College of Industrial Technology, led by a Vocational School Superintendent. By 1988, an administration building and a two-story building were constructed.</p>
                <p>In 1990, the school phased out its secondary education curriculum to concentrate on higher education programs, eventually graduating its first batch of baccalaureate degree students. Through the efforts of Dr. Bonifacio Villanueva and the backing of several legislators, President Arroyo signed a bill in 2009 that transformed the Cebu State College of Science and Technology System, along with its external campuses, into Cebu Technological University.</p>
                <p>Today, CTU Danao is one of the top campuses of the university, offering 19 undergraduate and 9 graduate programs to more than 4,156 students. Many of these programs have been accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP) with Level II and III accreditations.</p>
